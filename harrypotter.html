            <h1>History of the Series</h1>
            <img src="swear.jpg" class="hp">
            <p>The story began in June of 1997. 500 hardback copies were made, with 200 of those
                going to stores and the other 300 hitting libraries. It was hard for Rowling to even get
                the first book published. Many people turned her down because of the length of the story as well as the
                idea of the boarding school. However, once it got published, it was game over. Book after book until
                there was seven of them. Harry Potter has had over 500 million copies. This makes the series the
                bestselling book series of all time. It has been said that the only book that have been sold more times
                than Harry Potter is the Bible and The Red Book. </p>
            <h2>About the Author</h2>
