                    This is a website that will show and tell you why I love each season. While they are so different, each one has such unique features that make
                    it special for one reason or another. You can click on each tab up above to learn more about each specific season. You can always click on the home
                    button to take you back to this specific page. Enjoy the website and enjoy whatever season you are currently in while reading this!</p>

                    About the author</h2>
                <p>My name is Noelle and this website was created for the purpose of turning it in to my college class as an assignment. Everything
                    I write about here is to the best of my knowledge. I do love each season for different reasons and will explain more in each of the
                    different tabs. </p>
