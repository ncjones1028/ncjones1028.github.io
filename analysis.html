    <title>My Analysis of These Websites</title>

    <h1>1. Favorite State Website: Alaska</h1><a href="https://alaska.gov" target="_new">
        Here is a link to the website.</a>
    <p>This is my favorite website because of the simple format. It is easy to navigate through and
        I know how to find specific information because of the layout. For example, you can scroll down and
        see the different tabs for jobs, safety, health and education. I also like how on the right side you
        can see highlights such as how to buy a fishing license as well as Traveler Information. They make this
        website very friendly towards the public. The idea of putting "public Notices" on the right hand side as well was a smart
        move. It shows the viewer the dates of each notice and the area that it is affecting. My favorite part of all though is the
        "Kids' Corner". When you click on this option, it shows you student information, fun facts about Alaska,
        and even an Alaskan Blog. Having a website be kid-friendly as well as liked by adults is a great
        component that not all websites have!</p>



    <h1>2. My Second Favorite State Website: Tennessee</h1>
    <a href="https://www.tn.gov" target="_new">Here is a link to this website.</a>
    <p>This is my second favorite website because of how aesthetic the homepage looked.
        There were pictures everywhere and that made it look very nice and appealing. I think it is smart for
        websites to layout pictures for the public. I believe that if one adds pictures to their
        homepage, it can make the website look so much better! The first option of what to click on is "Residents". This
        makes it easy to navigate through the website as a local or as a traveler. I also was a fan of how one of the tabs says,
        "Directory". When you hover over it, it gives you the option of selecting the Department Directory as well as
        the State Phone Directory. Lastly, one of the tabs is a "Help" tab, which I find very pleasant. I always have some kind of problem
        that needs fixing on a website, and not all of them have this option. This website is very friendly towards the user.</p>

    <h1>3. My Third Favorite State Website: Vermont</h1>
    <a href="https://www.vermont.gov/" target="_new"> Here is a link to this website.</a>
    <p>This is my third favorite website because of the background picture on the homepage of the website.
        We learned how to do this in class, and it seemed somewhat complicated to get it even and to
        look appealing. The drop down tabs on the top were also a nice touch.I also liked drop down tabs because
        that makes it easier to look around the website and know where things are located.I found it nice that they
        included the "Latest News" as part of the homepage. This shows that they care about people knowing what
        is going on in the community.They also have an "Online Services" option, which is very nice if you are not
        local, or cannot leave your house. Having that option makes things a lot easier. However, I did think that the website was
        too plain. I think that it could have had more colors. </p>

    <h1> 4. My Fourth Favorite State Website: Oklahoma</h1>
    <a href="https://www.ok.gov/" target="=_new"> Here is a link to this website.</a>
    <p> My fourth favorite website was the Oklahoma one. This is because there was not much too it. You did not
        have to scroll far at all to find the bottom of the page. The website really did not offer
        much to the public, and it was also unappealing to look at. It seemed like an older website that
        had not been redone in awhile. The homepage doesn't even say "Oklahoma", it just says, "Ok". That
        can confuse the younger audience that is on the website. There is not that many links, and the page
        is not organized well at all. There is a little section with pictures, but it is not that visible unless you're looking
        for it. Overall, not my favorite website I have been on. </p>

    <h1> 5. My Fifth Favorite State Website: Iowa</h1>
    <a href="https://www.iowa.gov/" target="_new">Here is a link to this website.</a>
    <p> My least favorite website was the Iowa website. This is because I did not find the layout of the homepage
        very appealing. I had to scroll for a bit to just find the title of the website. I also thought there
        was just too much blue all over the homepage. Also, the only pictures visible were of two governers. I feel it is
        more appealing to put in pictures of the beautiful nature. Actually, I am not even sure who the second picture is of because it will not le me scroll to finish his name. That is very
        frusterating. I think that the only part I liked about this website was the Fun Facts. However, you need to
        scroll way to the bottom just to see this. This wesbite was not very user friendly, and therefore my least
        favorite.</p>
