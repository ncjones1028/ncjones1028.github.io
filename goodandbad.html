            The first website I thought was good was <a href="https://www.abercrombie.com/shop/us/womens-jeans-bottoms" target="_new"> Abercrombie and Fitch.</a> Specifically, the jean section. What I like about this website is the fact that
            there are different types of fits for the jeans, and there is a GIF of a girl wearing each one. With this, the viewer
            can see how the jeans look on someone from every angle. This makes it easier for them, or me, to decide if we want them
            or not. I also like how you can "sort by" on the left side, and everything is clearly labeled. The 15% off sale is in red
            at the bottom so customer's can easily see without it jumping out at you too much. The font they used is neat and
            very easily readable. There is a sort of clean cut look this website gives and I think it is very visually pleasing. The pictures
            for each item product is aligned perfectly, and so that makes the website look even more organized. The code for this website is written in HTML, and starts off with the ! DOCTYPE text that this website
            starts off with too. It looks clean and organized as well as easy to read. They use a bunch of elements I am familiar with
            such as head, link, class, div, id, style, and nav. I do not see anything with tables. The layout of this code makes sense
            to me. I can see where things begin and end, and I get how they are using div and classes. I can see where the GIFs are in the code
            and how those show up on the website. At the end of the code, which is about 40,000 lines, there are elements that I do not understand.
            It looks like gibberish to me. However, it ends neatly with the /html element we learned on day one of Web Design. As for the actual
            website, the colors are simple: pale navy blue and white. This simple color scheme makes the website easy on the eye and not distracting
            towards the products for the viewers.

            The second website that I found and really liked was <a href="https://shop.lululemon.com/?CID=Google_All_PPC%2BBrand_US&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI-I-Yno-o6AIVg9dkCh2uOgW0EAAYASAAEgJAe_D_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds" target="_new">LuluLemon.</a>
            I really liked this website for some of the same reasons that I liked Abercrombie. On the homepage, everything is boxy, which
            creates a theme. There also is not an overflow of different colors. The colors all go with the brand's logo. I really like the drop
            down affect with the nav. It makes things easy for the viewer. The search is located at the top right and is easy to see. You can scroll
            down to see what they are advertising currently. All the photos go together and show off the products well. The font is all
            completely in black, so it is easily readable and looks organized. In the footer, there is also an address. The bad website I found,
            which you will read about below, did not include this. It makes the site look and feel more legit. The code for this website
            is in HTML, however it does not look easy to read. There are no spaces and everything is bundled up together. It would not be easy for
            a person who knows little about HTML to understand. Href, link, and class are elements that I recognize. It does not give us the number of lines,
            but it is somewhere in between the first good website I chose and the bad website I talk about below. It is decently long though. The
            website is easy to navigate around and I like how they made it full of pictures and a simple one colored font.

            The website that I found and did not like very much was <a href="https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/dmv" target="_new">California DMV.</a>
            This website just seemed to be all over the place and not really organized efficiently. The title is different sizes which looks
            messy. The navigation is above the title, which seems odd in this format. The text all over the screen is different sized, different
            boldnesses, and randomly different colors. There is two different search buttons, which can be confusing to the viewer. There are
            weird dotted lines under the words in the footer and it looks like its spelled wrong. The code is written in HTML, and it used that
            same ! DOCTYPE element we use. The code is only 800 lines, which is a whole lot shorter than Abercrombie's, which was
            40,000. There also is a huge space in the code from lines 387 to 442, and again from 752 to 774. It is almost as if whoever made this code
            was trtyinThis code is definitely a lot more simple than Abercrombie's. They are using HTML elements that I know of
            such as div, class, style, header, and nav. I do not like how this website is layed out. It looks like all the different
            sections do not go together. It does not look like an official California certified website. It is harder to navigate around
            the website with all the different colors and themes. There is 6+ colors on just the homepage.
