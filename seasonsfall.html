                    Fall is such a fun season! It is also called Autumn, but I don't know a single
                    person that actually refers to it as that.The leaves are turning all sorts of colors and its the perfect temperature: not too hot
                    and not too cold. The trees are half bare and half colorful, with yellow, red, and orange leaves. It also is the time of year that the best holidays
                    occur. This includes Halloween, where we all get to dress up as whatever we want. Fall also includes the best holiday of all: my
                    birthday. Other "holidays" include my little sister's birthday, my older sister's birthday, and probably other people's birthdays that I
                    don't know. It also is when football season is, so we get to go to games and stand in the stands with everyone. It also is when parent
                    weekend takes place. This last year, my mom and sister came to visit. To top it all off, Fall is when the first semester of school happens.
                    New beginnings! And those are just some reasons of why I love the season of Fall!
